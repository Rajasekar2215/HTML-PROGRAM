    <p>A slogan is a short, memorable phrase or catchphrase that's often used to describe a product, political idea, or other thing. Slogans are a form of advertising and are often used by political groups to persuade the public to support their candidates. They can also be used by manufacturers, clans, or religious groups to express an idea or purpose.
